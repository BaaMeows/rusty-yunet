## Rusty YuNet

A thin rusty wrapper over the YuNet face detection network (aka `libfacedetect`).

Currently frozen to commit 
[40926655865c233b33d3de94302174efb6b5ac55](https://github.com/ShiqiYu/libfacedetection/tree/40926655865c233b33d3de94302174efb6b5ac55).

### Update strategy

At the moment, `Rusty Yunet` doesn't track the upstream YuNet repository, so any upstream patches must
be implemented manually. For the time being, these will be limited to significant bugfixes and security/safety
patches.
